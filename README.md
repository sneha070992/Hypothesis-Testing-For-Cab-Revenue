# Hypothesis-Testing-For-Cab-Revenue
Statistical Data analysis
A/B Hypothesis testing to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. We use Python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information that can help taxi drivers generate more cash. In particular, we want to find out if there is a big difference in the fares for those who pay with credit cards versus those who pay with cash.
